				<p>Hi, my name is Courtney. I'm 17 and a senior at Bartlett High School. Some of my favorite things to do are hiking, camping, and kayaking. My family and I always go to Gatlinburg to hike and Missouri to kayak. We just go to different places to camp. My immediate family consists of my brother, sister, my mom, dad, stepdad, my aunt, and my grandfather. I am the oldest of 3. My brother is 14 and my sister is 4. I work at Firehouse Subs and have been working there for about 6 months. I love it so far. Some other things I like are Star Wars and The Lord Of The Rings, but I'm more into outdoors stuff.</p>
